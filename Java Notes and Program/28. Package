A java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages.

Package in java can be categorized in two form, built-in package and user-defined package.

Advantage of Java Package
1) Java package is used to categorize the classes and interfaces so that they can be easily maintained.

2) Java package provides access protection.

3) Java package removes naming collision.


How to access package from another package?
There are three ways to access the package from outside the package.

import package.*;
import package.classname;
fully qualified name.


If you import a package, all the classes and interface of that package will be imported excluding the classes and interfaces of the subpackages. Hence, you need to import the subpackage as well.

Package inside the package is called the subpackage. It should be created to categorize the package further.
