Wrapper classes in Java
The wrapper class in Java provides the mechanism to convert primitive into object and object into primitive.

Java is an object-oriented programming language, so we need to deal with objects many times like in Collections, Serialization, Synchronization, etc.

Primitive Type	    Wrapper class

boolean	            Boolean
char	            Character
byte	            Byte
short	            Short
int	                Integer
long	            Long
float	            Float
double	            Double


Autoboxing
The automatic conversion of primitive data type into its corresponding wrapper class is known as autoboxing, for example, byte to Byte, char to Character, int to Integer, long to Long, float to Float, boolean to Boolean, double to Double, and short to Short.

Unboxing
The automatic conversion of wrapper type into its corresponding primitive type is known as unboxing. It is the reverse process of autoboxing. Since Java 5, we do not need to use the intValue() method of wrapper classes to convert the wrapper type into primitives.
