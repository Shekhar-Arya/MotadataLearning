Aggregation in Java

If a class have an entity reference, it is known as Aggregation. Aggregation represents HAS-A relationship.

Why use Aggregation?
For Code Reusability.

When use Aggregation?
Code reuse is also best achieved by aggregation when there is no is-a relationship.
Inheritance should be used only if the relationship is-a is maintained throughout the lifetime of the objects involved; otherwise, aggregation is the best choice.
