Method in Java: 
Similarly, the method in Java is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task. It provides the reusability of code. 

Method Declaration
The method declaration provides information about method attributes, such as Access Specifier, return-type, name, and arguments.


Method Signature: Every method has a method signature. It is a part of the method declaration. It includes the method name and parameter list.

Access Specifier: Access specifier or modifier is the access type of the method. It specifies the visibility of the method. Java provides four types of access specifier:

Public: The method is accessible by all classes when we use public specifier in our application.
Private: When we use a private access specifier, the method is accessible only in the classes in which it is defined.
Protected: When we use protected access specifier, the method is accessible within the same package or subclasses in a different package.
Default: When we do not use any access specifier in the method declaration, Java uses default access specifier by default. It is visible only from the same package only.
Return Type: Return type is a data type that the method returns. It may have a primitive data type, object, collection, void, etc. If the method does not return anything, we use void keyword.

Method Name: It is a unique name that is used to define the name of a method. It must be corresponding to the functionality of the method. Suppose, if we are creating a method for subtraction of two numbers, the method name must be subtraction(). A method is invoked by its name.

Parameter List: It is the list of parameters separated by a comma and enclosed in the pair of parentheses. It contains the data type and variable name. If the method has no parameter, left the parentheses blank.

Method Body: It is a part of the method declaration. It contains all the actions to be performed. It is enclosed within the pair of curly braces.


Types of Method
There are two types of methods in Java:

Predefined Method : Math.max(9,7)
User-defined Method
No args No return type method
No args return type method
Args no return type method
Args with return type method


Static Method
A method that has static keyword is known as static method. In other words, a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class is known as a static method. We can also create a static method by using the keyword static before the method name.

Instance Method
The method of the class is known as an instance method. It is a non-static method defined in the class. Before calling or invoking the instance method, it is necessary to create an object of its class.

Getter and Setter methods
This methods are used to get and set the values to the encapsulated variables.

// Getter method
public int getId()    
{    
return Id;    
}    

// Setter Method
public void setRoll(int roll)   
{  
this.roll = roll;  
}



Abstract Method
The method that does not has method body is known as abstract method. In other words, without an implementation is known as abstract method. It always declares in the abstract class. It means the class itself must be abstract if it has abstract method. To create an abstract method, we use the keyword abstract.




Method Overloading means Two or more methods in a class has same name but different parameters.
