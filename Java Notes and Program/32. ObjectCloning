The object cloning is a way to create exact copy of an object. The clone() method of Object class is used to clone an object.

Student18 s2=(Student18)s1.clone();  Example but this keep in a try block


public Object clone()throws CloneNotSupportedException{  //provide this method 
return super.clone();  
}  

And class must implements Cloneable interface.
